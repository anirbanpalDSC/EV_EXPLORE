## Data description

### VESICLEPEDIA_PROTEIN_MRNA_DETAILS_5.1.txt

A curated compendium of molecular data related to extracellular vesicles (EVs) (such as exosomes, microvesicles, and ectosomes).

#### ðŸ§¬ Purpose

Vesiclepedia aggregates experimentally validated molecules that have been identified in extracellular vesicles from various organisms, tissues, and cell types.
This particular file (PROTEIN_MRNA_DETAILS_5.1.txt) lists proteins and mRNAs associated with those vesicles.

Itâ€™s a tab-delimited text file with tens of thousands of rows â€” each row is an entry describing a protein or mRNA identified in EVs.
